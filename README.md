# Youtube-Downloader-and-Converter

This is a YouTube downloader I created after getting tired of dealing with online downloaders. The main function of this application if for downloading music from YouTube Music while it plays in a Chrome tab on the side. It comes with a bunch of little features I have found useful. Hovering over elements in the application will give a description of what their function is. Also included is an audio converter that uses ffmpeg. After starting the application, you will have to give it time to download ffmpeg. After which, the download button will become enabled.

How to download:

1. It has two ways to get the Url of a video for downloading.
    1. Reads the currently active Chrome tab for the Url and pulls that information.
    2. By double clicking on the Url text box, Chrome reading is disabled and manual input of a Url is allowed.

2. You can change the download directory by clicking on the text box contain the default music folder file path and selecting a folder.

3. Hit the Download button and wait.

4. Profit.

Features Included:

-Download the highest quality Opus file

-Download the video in .mp4 format at the highest quality up to 1080p

-Place the downloaded file in a subfolder named after the channel name (e.g. .../Music/YouTube/Imagine Dragons)

-Automatically start downloading if a new YouTube Url is detected from Chrome

-Lock the application to a specific Chrome window. This allows for multiple windows to be opened without the application jumping from the previously active window to the currently active.

-Uses the windows media skip function to skip to the next song after the current song has started downloading. There is a roughly 10 second delay before skipping. This feature was added in order to download YouTube playlists.

-Stop the application from downloading videos/songs that contain text. This text can be changed.

-When downloading music, allows a track number to be written into the metadata. 0 means no track number will be written.

-Write the track number before the file name. (e.g. .../Music/Youtube/04-Believer.mp3)

-Automatically increase the track number every time a new Url is detected.

-Shows the amount of YouTube videos that are in que for downloading. This is useful when auto downloading is enabled

-An audio file converter I included for a friend to convert sound mod music from Hoi4 into .mp3 so we could burn it to a disk for his car. for the funnies.

-Clear any folders in the selected downloads folder that DO NOT contain AT LEAST ONE (1) .mp3 file. I included this becaus I had hundreds of folders in my music directory and used musicbrainz to add metadata and clean it up. It didn't delete the now empty folders and going through manually would have been a pain.

-Funny gag checkbox that makes you think there are ads and that they could be disabled. There is a way to enable that element to then uncheck it by clicking the correct area. Wonder how many people will read this far.
